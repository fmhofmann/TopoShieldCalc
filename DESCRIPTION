Title: Topographic shielding calculation with the aid of a digital elevation model.
Version: 1.0
Date: 2024_10-11
Language: en-UK
Imports: terra, readODS
Description: This R package allows for calculating topographic shielding factors for discrete sampling sites with the aid of a digital elevation model (DEM). Both a shapefile (.shp) and a DEM (.tif) are required to compute shielding factors. This package involves funtions of the terra and the readODS packages which need to be installed prior to shielding factor calculation.
